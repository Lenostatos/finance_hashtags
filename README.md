# finance_hashtags

Hello there! This is my first public project so I very much appreciate any tips and/or help you can give me.

This project should result in an application for private users that offers convenient finance tracking capabilities.

Key features should be:
+ Users can categorize their transactions with hashtags and then filter for these hashtags.
+ The GUI shoul be as intuitive as possible.

### Disclaimer:
This project will be handed in as a course assessment for a programming course and one of the requirements is that
VisualBasic has to be used.
