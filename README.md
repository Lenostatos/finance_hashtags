# finance_hashtags

Hello there! This is my first public project so I very much appreciate any tips and/or help you can give me.

This project should result in an application for private users that offers convenient finance tracking capabilities.

Key features should be:
+ Users can input all their transactions, i.e. money they receive and money they spend.
+ Transactions can be categorized with hashtags and the user can then filter for these hashtags.
+ A GUI that is as welcoming as possible to users with a low affinity for computers.

### Disclaimer:
This project will be handed in as a course assessment for a programming course in February 2019 and one of the requirements is that
VisualBasic has to be used.
