# Object Properties
+ Write the "Property" code only if necessary.
+ Properties exposed to the outside should NOT start with an underscore except when they would otherwise conflict with a VB.Net keyword.
+ Properties only used inside of their class should start with an underscore.
+ Do NOT use auto property because it is less well readable.
+ Write down the "ByVal" keyword for the "Set" part for writing consistency even so "ByRef" wouldn't be possible there.
+ Use "value" as a parameter name for the "Set" part just because it's faster as Visual Studio automatically writes it for you.

# Logical Statements
+ Always use "AndAlso" and "OrElse" instead of "And" and "Or".

# Class Code
+ Always use the "Me" keyword for better readability.
