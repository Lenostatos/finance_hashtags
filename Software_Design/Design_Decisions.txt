# Localisation
+ Text on GUI elements will be available in different languages.
+ These localized texts will be stored within a table in the database or maybe even an own database.
+ There will be one class/module that provides the texts for the GUI and has a property that allows the user to set the desired language.
+ Strings that are used within the code and don't need localization will be "hard coded" into modules.

# Data Structure and Constraints
+ The user will be able to input multiple transactions with the same date and time because this is expected to be the best trade-off between user convenience and meaningful data input.

# Multi-user feature
+ There won't be any for now.
+ In the future multi-user support might be realised by creating an own database for every user.
	+ Allows to maintain the current database design.
	+ Protects from data manipulation in between users.
	+ Uses more disk space as opposed to storing all the data in one database.

# Back referencing of components to the instances they are contained in
+ The back referencing is supposed to help with inserting data back into the database.
+ Doing this in the data model would consume memory and create two-sided relationships which might cause problems.
+ Therefore this additional information will be stored only in the model part that stores the updates which are supposed to be reported to the database.
