# Localisation
+ Text on GUI elements will be available in different languages.
+ These localized texts will be stored within a table in the database or maybe even an own database.
+ There will be one class/module that provides the texts for the GUI and has a property that allows the user to set the desired language.
+ Strings that are used within the code and don't need localization will be "hard coded" into modules.

# Data Structure and Constraints
+ The user will be able to input multiple transactions with the same date and time because this is expected to be the best trade-off between user convenience and meaningful data input.

# Multi-user feature
+ There won't be any for now.
+ In the future multi-user support might be realised by creating an own database for every user.
	+ Allows to maintain the current database design.
	+ Protects from data manipulation in between users.
	+ Uses more disk space as opposed to storing all the data in one database.

# Entity Framework
+ I chose MicroLite because of this article about EFs that are easily accessible for inexperienced programmers and work well with SQLite: https://www.codeguru.com/columns/dotnet/the-sorry-state-of-.net-orms.html
